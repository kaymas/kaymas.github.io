    <h1>Collatz Conjecture</h1>
    <p>An illustration of Collatz Conjecture
      Which takes a number of random numbers
      and then calculates its Collatz sequence
      after which its branch is created on the canvas.
      If a number in the sequence is even then it is
      rotated clockwise and if it is odd then counter-clockwise.</p>
    <p>Refresh to look at different set of random numbers<p>

    <h2>Note regarding the branch.</h2>
    <p> Since the there are more even numbers in
        the sequence of a collatz branch hence the branch
        tends to tilt along one side(in this case downwards).
        This can be fixed by modifying the function by which
        the angle of the line in the branch is calculated.<br><br></p>
